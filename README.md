# get-location-js

This code checks if the browser supports the Geolocation API using the `navigator.geolocation` object. If it's supported, the `getCurrentPosition()` method is called with a callback function that receives a `Position` object with the user's current latitude and longitude coordinates. This information can then be used as needed. If Geolocation is not supported by the browser, the code logs a message to the console.
